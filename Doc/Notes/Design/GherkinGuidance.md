#### [#A] Present Perfect Tense

In Gherkin syntax, "Given" statements describe the context or preconditions before the main actions occur. While they introduce a state or condition that has been established before the scenario's actions, they are typically written in the present tense to reflect the current state of the system.

For example:

"Given the user is logged in"
"Given the account balance is $100"
"Given the default log file is open"
Using the present tense in "Given" statements is standard practice because it clearly describes the current state resulting from past actions, providing a clear and immediate context for the scenario.
