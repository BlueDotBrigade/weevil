# Testing

## General

Sample log file: /weevil/Tst/BlueDotBrigade.Weevil.Core-UnitTests/.Daten/.Global/Default.log

## Functional Testing

The Weevil core engine can be accessed via:
1. WPF Application
2. Console Application
3. PowerShell

For this reason, it is best to perform the majority of testing at the `BlueDotBrigade.Weevil.Core` level.
