# Weevil

## Environment Setup

- It is expected that the `%WEEVIL_PLUGINS_PATH%` [environment variable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_variable#Windows) will point to a directory where additional plugins can be found.
   - For example: `C:\SourceCode\weevil-plugins\MyCompanyName.Weevil.Plugins\bin\x64\Debug`
